# CMPS12 I2C Library for STM32

👾 i made this library last year to access a cmps12 gyro. All addresses i used are based on its [datasheet](https://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/files/cmps12.pdf)

i pushed the entire STM32 base project here so it'll be easier to use.      
❗You can find the cmps12 source file in   ```Core/Src/cmps12_gyro.c``` and header file in ```Core/Src/cmps12_gyro.h```.

👾 In this project i used STM32F407VET6 with I2C3

Based on my result on testing this gyro,   
1. it has bearing which you can access and use, it'll give you a very accurate result of rotation (0 to 360 degree)   
2. i tried the gyro z by integrating its acceleration, but it'll give you some error/drifts by time    


> fun fact: i shorted 1 cmps12 while experimenting with it:"
